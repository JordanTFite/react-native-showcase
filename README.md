# React Native Showcase

This repository contains a React Native application that showcases the following skills:

- UI/UX Design. All content aside from icons and navigation tabs is designed by hand. 
  Other application's designs were replicated as a case study (Instagram, Spotify)
- Tab navigation using `react-navigation`
- Application context using `useContext` and `useReducer`
- REST API calls using `axios`


Note - The API configured in the application is pointing to a localhost Express server. 
The "Users" tab will not function properly if this application is run locally.
